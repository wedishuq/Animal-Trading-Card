			<p class="fact-label">Many parrots have near-human lifespans, a consideration many people don’t truly grasp when seeking a parrot as a companion. Larger species like macaws and cockatoos are known to live for between 35 and 50 years. Tarbu, an African grey in England, lived to the ripe old age of 55. The current oldest parrot is 82-year-old Cookie, a Major Mitchell’s cockatoo (Lophochroa leadbeateri) that resides at the Brookfield Zoo in Chicago. <a href="http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/14-fun-facts-about-parrots-180957714/?no-ist">(Reference) </a></p>

			<p>The species is common in captivity and is regularly kept by humans as a companion parrot, prized for its ability to mimic human speech, which makes it one of the most popular avian pets. They are notorious for mimicking noises around their environment and using them tirelessly. While they are highly intelligent birds they need a lot of enrichment and attention in captivity or they can become distressed, feather plucking is a common symptom. However, it may be prone to behavioural problems due to its sensitive nature. African greys are also highly intelligent, having been shown to perform at the cognitive level of a 4–6 year old child in some tasks. New experiments have shown that African greys can learn number sequences and can associate human voices with that human’s face. Most notably, Dr Irene Pepperberg's work with Alex the parrot showed his ability to learn over 100 words, differentiating between objects, colors, materials, and shapes. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_grey_parrot#Relationship_to_humans">(Reference)</a></p>
